## List of miracles that Slackpoint can perform‚ú®:

- Create a new task
- Mark task as done
- View pending tasks
- View completed tasks
- Ask for help

Let's go over these one by one...

#### **1. Create new task:**

You can create a new task by simple using the `/create-task` command. We ask for just a few more parameters in addition to that:

Command: `/create`

![Create Task GIF](https://i.imgur.com/lUtX23a.gif)

This particular command will create a new task with the description as `Hey! This is my new task` having `100` points and a deadline of `15th October 2022`

#### **2. Mark task as done:**

Here you can mark a task as completed. You just need to give the task ID as a parameter

Command: `/task-done [task ID]`

Example:
`/task-done 10214`

![Task Done GIF](https://i.imgur.com/gOB6dVs.gif)

This will mark the task having task ID `10214` as completed. Further, updates records to show that this task is completed by user who posted this command

#### **3. View pending tasks:**

This command will return the list of incomplete tasks. Relax! no parameters required here

Command: `/viewpending [no parameters]`
