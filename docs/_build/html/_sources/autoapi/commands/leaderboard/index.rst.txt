.. py:class:: Leaderboard

   This class generates a leaderboard, displaying the top point scorers based on completed tasks.

   **Why**: Useful for tracking task completion in a gamified environment, allowing users to see where they stand
   compared to others and encouraging active participation in completing tasks.

   **How**: Common usage examples:
   1. `Leaderboard.view_leaderboard(top_k=5)`: Retrieve the top 5 users based on points.


   .. py:attribute:: base_leaderboard_block_format


   .. py:attribute:: payload


   .. py:method:: view_leaderboard(top_k: int = 5) -> dict

      Retrieves and formats the leaderboard with the top K users by points from completed tasks.

      :param top_k: Number of top users to display on the leaderboard, default is 5.
      :type top_k: int
      :return: Payload containing leaderboard information for the top K users.
      :rtype: dict[str, Any]

      **Why**: Displays high-performing users in a structured format, motivating users to stay engaged by
      highlighting achievements and fostering a sense of competition.
      **How**: Example usage -
      ```
      top_users = leaderboard.view_leaderboard(top_k=10)
      ```
